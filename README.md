Welcome to my profile! I'm @alejandroad

I have built several projects over my time at the University of Texas at Austin. I really love programming in Java and doing worK on backend or systems.

I am interested in full stack software development as a career, and interested in research as an academic hobby.

This past summer, I interned at Amazon.com as a Software Development Engineer Intern in Seattle. It was a very rewarding and enriching professional expirence. During my time at Amazon, I gatherd skills in software development. I caught up on different technologies such as Typescript, Redux, StencilJS and more. I learned about continuous integration and piplelines. Work sprints. Code reviews. I am happy to accounce that I have accepted to return to my geat team at Amazon next summer 2023 in Seattle once more!

I am currently looking for resarch opportunitues for spring 2023 at the University of Texas at Austin! My reasoning for this is that I would like to expand on my technical capabilties, and I am very interested in the academic side of CS. I would like to have both industrial and academic experience, and really hone by skills and craft within the field of Computer Science.

Thanks for reading! If you have any inquiries, I can be contacted at: alejandroariasdiaz09@gmai.com
